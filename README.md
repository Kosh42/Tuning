# Community Tuning Guide for FDM Printers


This is not an instruction manual. It is not a template to great prints. It is not the only way of doing things.

What this guide aims to provide is an outline of the order of steps I go through to tune a printer, and some of the thinking/decision making I apply along the way. There are different ways to do this, there are probably better ways, but I can only tell you about my way, so here goes.

This guide assumes that you've already done everything in the Setup Guide for your relevant printer. That should get you to the point where your printer homes, passes all electronic checks, and you've calibrated extrusion steps (e-steps).

Fair warning - you are not going to progress from the first step to the last step in a straight line and then declare "done!". You are going to iterate. Potentially lots.
