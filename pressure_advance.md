Pressure advance is another parameter that has a really good klipper guide for it1. It does an equivalent job to Linear Advance in Marlin, and helps to smooth out any blobbing/oozing caused by changes in speed as you go through a print. I always use the method outlined in the klipper documentation, however you will find alternative methods that people use. If you prefer those, use them, but if you're reading this guide I would suggest you start with the official way.

NOTE: Tuning Pressure Advance is one of the steps that may mean you have to tweak your Flow/Extrusion Multiplier again. Or not. This is where experience and iteration come into play.
