Superslicer to the rescue again here. There are various test models for this but I'd really recommend using the calibration wizard in Superslicer for this. Though beware the default spacing between objects, your Afterburner will crash into the already printed parts if you don't increase it from default!

NOTE: Were you not quite sure which temperature to choose back in the initial temperature calibration tower? This might answer your question.
